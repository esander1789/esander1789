A recent article in Chaos [Barreto et al.] describes a drive-response
system coupling a parametrized family of noninvertible modified baker
maps with a nonlinear response. The article describes the effect of
noninvertibility on the synchronization set (i.e. the attractor).
Namely, at the bifurcation parameter, the syncronization set has a
cusp. For every parameter after the bifurcation, there is a
multivalued synchronization set with self-intersections, or loops.
See Animation 1. This example is a special case in which the
noninvertibility occurs at a critical point of the synchronization
set.  In contrast, the synchronization set generically continues to be
a smooth nonintersecting curve even after the onset of
noninvertibility.  See Animation 2a and 2b. This is described more
fully in an upcoming article by Josic and Sander.

Caption 1: u versus y in the exceptional case of
Barreto et al., as the parameter varies, a smooth manifold forms a
cusp, which turns into a loop.

Caption 2a: u versus y in the typical case; the
noninvertibility does not occur at a critical point. Therefore the
synchronization set becomes multivalued as a graph but retains its
smooth manifold structure.
