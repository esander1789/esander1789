Marlowe was upset that there were all these movies, none of which he
was starring in. I found the perfect role for his movie debut: this is
an example from dynamical systems, in which the mathematician
V.I. Arnold's cat first appeared (as a still series of images). This
may be the first cinematic version.

<p>

This movie shows what happens to the torus (standard identification of
the square), when mapped by a linear Anosov diffeomorphism. The
mapping has a stretching and a contracting direction. Each
toral Anosov diffeomorphism is  equivalent to a linear one.

<p>

How does this look on the standard embedded image of the torus?
Marlowe wouldn't try it, as he was afraid to get his tail tied in
knots, but his costar The Clown was willing, and appears in <a
