</p><h1>Automatic Groups: A class of groups solving the word problem<!--
--></h1><pre></pre>
<p>

One of the first things a group theorist would like to know about a
group element is whether it is the identity element. When the group is
a finitely generated group given in terms of generators and relations,
the question is known as the word problem. Namely, the word problem
asks if there is an algorithmic method to decide whether an element
given in terms of a product of generators is the identity. Though this
seems like a simple request, it is not possible to solve the word
problem in general. Thus it is difficult to study finitely generated
groups, since the above result implies that in general one cannot tell
whether two given products of generators represent the same element.
</p><p>
In some recent research in computational group theory, J. Cannon, W.
Thurston, and D. Epstein were able to define a large class of groups
for which it is possible to solve the word problem.  Groups of this
class are called automatic groups. Not only is it possible to solve
the word problem for automatic groups, but by representing an
automatic group by a special automatic structure, it is possible to
solve the word problem in an efficient manner.
</p><p>
The concept of an automatic structure is not abstract; Epstein, S.
Rees, and D. Holt have written software which inputs a set of
generators and relations of a group and, when the group is automatic,
gives back an automatic structure.
</p><p>
Automatic groups are based on the computer scientists' concept of
finite state automata. Briefly, a finite state automaton uses an
algorithmic method to determine whether objects called "words" have
particular properties by looking at their components, called
"letters." The automaton reads a word one letter at a time. After
reading a letter, of which there are only a finite number, the
automaton records that it is in a certain one of a finite number of
"states."  At any time, the only information the automaton knows is
what state it is in. This state and the next letter read entirely
determine the state the automaton goes to next. The state may be an
"accept" state. This means that the word that led to this state has
the desired property. If the automaton does not reach an accept state
before it finishes reading all the letters in a word, then the
automaton rejects the word. This means the word does not have the
desired property. Note that since there are only a finite number of
states in the automaton, it only takes a finite amount of information
to determine whether to accept a given word. Thus even though there
might be an infinite number of words, an automaton guarantees that a
for one word, a property is determined in a finite amount of time
using a finite amount of information.
</p><p>
In the context of groups, the words in a finite state automaton are
products of generators of the group, and the generators themselves are
the letters. Note that two words can represent the same group element.
For example, assuming that all elements of a finite group are
generators, for any x in the group, the identity word and the word
(x)(x^(-1)) represent the same group element.  One possible group
automaton is one which accepts a word only when it is a representation
of the identity element. Since an automaton rejects or accepts words
in a finite amount of time, whenever such an automaton exists, it is
possible to solve the word problem.
</p><p>
An automatic group is one with three kinds of associated finite state
automata. They are a word acceptor, which determines whether a
representation is in reduced form, an equality recognizer, which
decides if two words are equal, and a multiplier for each generator,
which determines whether a word is equal to a second word times the
generator. By the second type of automata, we know that automatic
groups solve the word problem. Although the existence of these three
kinds of automata sounds like a stringent condition, many important
groups are automatic.
</p><p>
Two examples of automatic groups are Euclidean groups, meaning
discrete groups of isometries of Euclidean spaces, and word-hyperbolic
groups. In order to define word-hyperbolic groups, we need to discuss
Cayley graphs; the Cayley graph is a graph with a point for each
element of the group and with a directed line from one point to a
second point whenever the second element is the first element times
one of the generators. For example, Figure 1 shows Cayley graphs for
the two distinct four element groups. A path in a Cayley graph is a
series of lines that match start to end; a path corresponds to
multiplication by a series of generators. The length of a path is the
number of lines making up the path; path length corresponds to the
number of generators in the product. The distance between two points
on the Cayley graph is the length of the shortest path between the two
points.

A word-hyperbolic group is one whose Cayley graph has the following
property: given a triangle with edges of shortest possible length to
still join the vertices, the distance from a point on one edge to the
union of the other two edges is bounded by some constant. For example,
any group for which the Cayley graph can be embedded nicely in the
hyperbolic plane is a word-hyperbolic group. See Figure 2.

Aside from the word problem, the automatic structure of a group allows
people to quickly and efficiently draw a variety of geometric objects.
For example, see Figure 3, figures from a recent paper by Greg
McShane, John Parker, and Ian Redfern. Some of the scenes in the
Geometry Center movie "Not Knot" were made using automatic groups. I
asked Charlie Gunn, the movie's technical director, what he thought of
them: "The use of automatic groups can provide significant
acceleration when providing large lists of group elements. For
example, the Geometry Center poster depicting the a frame from the
fly-through of hyperbolic space from 'Not Knot' used a list of over
100,000 group elements; this list took only a few minutes to compute
with the automatic structure.  Without automatic groups, the same list
would require hours of computation.  Another advantage of automatic
structure is extremely low memory requirements; without it the full
list of group elements must be kept, as matrices, in memory throughout
the computation."

group &lt; z -&gt; z+2 , z -&gt; mu + 1/z &gt;
where mu = 0.06469 + 1.912 i. The cosets of the stabiliser of the real
line are enumerated using an automaton. This enables us to draw each
image of the real line under the group exactly once. (Figure 1a in
paper below.)
