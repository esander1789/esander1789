<p>
The following article describes software written for
the Macintosh by Jeff Weeks. It also includes puzzlers
which can be solved without the software. All of the
programs are available free using anonymous ftp. See the
end of the article for details.
</p><p>
"Explaining simple closed manifolds such as the
two-torus, the Klein bottle, and three-torus becomes
easier," says Jeff Weeks, "if students get a good
gut-level understanding by playing games in them. The
students experience the manifolds first, and only later
discuss them theoretically."  To this end, Weeks has
written programs to allow students to get an intuition
for some two- and three-dimensional manifolds. He has
used the programs with high school and college students
and says they make a good introduction to simple two- and
three-dimensional manifolds. Here is a brief
description of three of them, including some puzzlers
for torus and Klein bottle chess.
</p><p>
<b>1. Flight Simulator</b>
</p><p>
This is a program to learn about three-dimensional
manifolds. It shows what you see when you travel in the
three-sphere, projective three-space, or many other
three-manifolds. You can travel any direction you want
using the mouse.  For example, Figure 1 shows a cube as
viewed in the three-torus. (See the program's About Box, the
first item in the apple menu, for flying instructions.)

<b>2. Hyperbolic MacDraw</b>
</p><p>
This program allows the user to draw lines, draw shapes,
rotate, and translate, in the same way as any draw
program, except that rather than Euclidean space, the
drawings appear in the user's choice of Poincare, Klein,
or upper half plane model of the hyperbolic plane. The
user can discover the many oddities of hyperbolic space.
For example, the user immediately notices that in some
models of the hyperbolic plane, lines appear straight,
whereas in other models, they appear curved.
</p><p>
<img src="weeks_software_files/figure2.gif">
</p><p>
Figure 2
shows two regular polygons drawn using Hyperbolic
MacDraw in the Poincare model. The sides are equal length
and straight in the hyperbolic plane.
</p><p>
When students first wrote Hyperbolic MacDraw, as a term
project in Weeks' undergraduate Geometry class, they
came to Weeks and said, "The translation seems to work,
except that when you translate an object around a loop in
the plane, when it gets back to where it started, it seems
to have rotated. We can't find the bug in our program." The
program was working correctly. The students had
discovered one of the odd properties of curved spaces. For example, in
Figure 3b, the object in Figure 3a has been translated around a loop.
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p>
In the hyperbolic plane, when a
translated object returns to its starting point, it has
rotated by the amount of area enclosed by its path. This is
true on a sphere as well, except that on the sphere the
object rotates in the same direction that you transversed
the loop, whereas in hyperbolic plane, the rotation is in
the opposite direction.
</p><p>
<b>3. Torus and Klein bottle chess</b>
</p><p>
One way to represent the torus or Klein bottle is as a
square with opposite sides identified as in Figure 4.
</p><p>
<img src="weeks_software_files/figure4.gif">
</p><p>
This chess program presents a chess board with sides
identified in this fashion. The players can move a chess
piece off one side of the board, at which point it appears
on the other side of the board. There are two alterations
to the rules for standard chess. One, the initial
position is as shown in Figure 5.
</p><p>
<img src="weeks_software_files/figure5.gif">
</p><p>
It is different from the
starting position for standard chess, since with the
usual starting point on the torus or Klein bottle, the
game would begin with massive slaughter. Second, in this
game pawns can move one square in a straight line in any
direction and capture diagonally in any direction.
</p><p>
<img src="weeks_software_files/figure6a.gif">
</p><p>
<img src="weeks_software_files/figure6b.gif">
</p><p>
<img src="weeks_software_files/figure6c.gif">
</p><p>
Figures 6a and 6b show a possible rook move on a Klein
bottle board, to give you an idea of how the play looks.
Figure 6c shows the same board as in 6b, except that the
board has been scrolled.
</p><p>
Here are some torus and Klein bottle chess puzzlers:
</p><p>
(1) In Klein bottle chess, starting from the initial
position in Figure 5, can the white bishop capture the
black rook in one move?
</p><p>
(2) What happens when you move a piece straight into a
corner in torus chess?  In Klein bottle chess?
</p><p>
(3) Starting from the initial position in Figure 5, how
can a black knight capture a white rook in one move?
Note that  that one of the
white knights in Figure 6c appears to be mirror-reversed
from the way it was in Figure 6b. Similarly, with
the board in its initial position, the black knight
appears to get mirror-reversed as it captures the white
rook.  But if you first scroll the board down a few rows,
then the black knight does not appear to get reversed as it
captures the white rook. Does it get reversed or doesn't
it?
</p><p>
Here are some more involved questions for chess experts:
</p><p>
(A) In traditional chess, a pawn is worth 1, a knight or
bishop 3, a rook 5 and a queen 9. How do these relative
values change on a torus? On a Klein bottle?
</p><p>
(B) Experiment with different starting positions for
the pieces.  Send particularly good starting positions
to weeks@geom.umn.edu.  [Note: as of 2003, reach Jeff Weeks as <i>weeks at geometrygames.org</i>.]
