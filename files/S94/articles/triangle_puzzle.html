<p>

Pick an arbitrary point in the interior of an equilateral triangle.
Now go halfway towards one of the three vertices (you get to pick
which vertex). Now you are at a new point in the triangle.  Again go
halfway towards any vertex. Continue this process.
</p><p>
What is the long term behavior? In other words, what points can you
reach after repeating this process an arbitrarily large number of
times?
</p><p>
I am interested in using this problem to demonstrate the use of
computers in teaching. Please let me know if you solve it using computers
and what software you use. I will post an answer next week.

Happy Thanksgiving!

Remember:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>When I ask "what points can you reach after repeating this process
an arbitrarily large number of times," I had in mind: "what points are
the limit of infinite sequences of applications of this process?"
Thank you to Dan Asimov for pointing this out. This is also the answer
to Art Mabbot's question: I do not want you to save points along the
way; just look at where they tend to cluster if you could apply the
process forever.
<p>
</p></li><li>At each stage, you are free to
choose which vertex from which to halve your distance. You do not have
to do so in cyclic order.
<p>
</p></li><li>In accordance with 1 above, it is not
important whether your point starts in the interior or on the boundary
of the triangle. However, I do not allow for points in the exterior of
the triangle.
</li></ol>
