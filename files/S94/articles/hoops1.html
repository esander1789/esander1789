</p><h1>Hoops in Three-Space</h1>

A hoop is a geometric unit circle in three-space, or in
other words, the result of applying a three dimensional
rigid motion to the unit circle in the plane. Notice that
a hoop is a circular curve and not a disk. Asimov
considers what kind of three-dimensional  regions one
can fill with non-intersecting (but possibly
interlocking) hoops. He is interested in the specific
method of filling volumes with hoops,  requiring that the
hoops be placed in a continuous manner.
</p><p>

Here is a precise definition of continuity of hoops in a
region of three space: One can specify a hoop using a
center point and a normal direction. If hoops fill a
region, then there is a map which assigns to each point in
the region the hoop passing through that point. A
continuous placement of hoops is one in which this map is
continuous. (Technical note: The center of a hoop is a
point in three space, R^3. The normal is a point on the unit
sphere, S^2 or on the projective plane, P^2, depending on
whether hoops are oriented or unoriented. Thus the map
goes from R^3 to either R^3 x S^2 or R^3 x P^2.)
</p><p>

It is in fact possible to fill all of three-space with
disjoint hoops. In 1964 J. Conway and H.T. Croft  proved
this using an Axiom of Choice argument. However, the
placement of the hoops is not continuous or
constructive, as is generally the case with the Axiom of
Choice.
</p><p>

One can use a continuous placement of hoops to cover a
"unit torus," meaning a torus of revolution whose core
circle has radius one. (An example of this is the result of
revolving the circle (x-1)^2 + y^2 = r^2 in R^2 about the
z-axis of R^3. The shape of a unit torus is determined by
the radius r &lt; 1 of the circle being revolved.)
</p><p>
Notice the relationship between a unit torus and hoops; a
unit torus is a surface of revolution around a hoop. In
order to continuously fill a unit torus with disjoint
hoops, each hoop must tilt so that it goes around the
non unit circle of the torus exactly once as it goes
around the unit circle of the torus.
</p><p>

Using this covering method for unit tori with (non unit)
circles of all radii between zero and r, it is possible to
continuously fill a solid radius r unit torus with
disjoint hoops. Fattening the torus as much as possible
without having the hoops intersect, one obtains a solid
unit torus of radius one (by slight abuse of
terminology). This means the torus has no hole in the
center. Asimov terms this shape a "bialy," after a kind of
bread similar to a bagel.
</p><p>

The bialy at least gives a lower bound of 2*(pi^2) for the
possible connected volumes one can continuously fill with
disjoint hoops.  What about an upper bound? Asimov proved
that for a set of hoops which fill a connected volume, any two
hoops must link. Thus any volume continuously filled with
hoops must fit inside a ball of radius three (whose volume
is 36*pi). Although he does not yet have a least upper
bound, it is clear that the restriction to continuous
placement of hoops is indeed a severe restriction on the
possible filled volume; it changes the possible region
from all of three space to a region contained in a ball
radius three!
</p><p>

Asimov is currently trying to extend his results on
hoops. He is considering a variety of dimensions of
geometric unit spheres in higher dimensional spaces.
