<p>
One of the long-standing problems of dynamical systems is to prove or
disprove the following 1950 postulate of Seifert:
</p><p>
Seifert Conjecture: Every non-vanishing vector field on the
three-sphere has a periodic orbit.
</p><p>
After many years, this conjecture is now known to be false. In 1974,
P.A. Schweitzer constructed a C^1-smooth counterexample (i.e. the
vector field in this counterexample is once continuously
differentiable). In 1988, J. Harrison constructed a C^2
counterexample. Finally, just this past summer, K.M. Kuperberg solved
the problem conclusively, when she constructed an infinitely
continuously differentiable counterexample. This article gives some of
the background of the problem as it arises in Hamiltonian systems,
differential geometry, and topology. Part 2 gives a heuristic
description of Kuperberg's counterexample. Parts 1 and 2 are both
based on a recent seminar by Richard McGehee, University of Minnesota
mathematics professor and interim director of the Geometry Center.
Notation: for the rest of this article, I refer to the two-sphere as
S^2 and the three-sphere as S^3.
</p><p>
The Hamiltonian Case
</p><p>
Consider the following Hamiltonian system of differential equations on
R^4 (x and y are vectors in R^2):
</p><p>
</p><pre>  x'=y
  y'=-x
</pre>
<p>
Solutions of this differential equation stay within a fixed level set
of its Hamiltonian H(x,y) = |x|^2+|y|^2. The level sets, {(x,y):
H(x,y)=h, where h is constant}, are diffeomorphic to S^3 for positive
h. Thus we can restrict to a vector field on S^3. The simplest kinds
of solutions to understand are fixed points and periodic orbits. Thus
we are interested in whether there are any periodic orbits. In other
words, does the Seifert conjecture hold for this example? In fact in
this particular example, all solutions are periodic. What happens if
we perturb this system by a Hamiltonian perturbation? For small enough
perturbation, Weinstein showed that the system will still have at
least two periodic orbits.
</p><p>
We do not have to restrict our attention to perturbations of this
specific system. More generally, consider any Hamiltonian system in
R^4. If a level set for the Hamiltonian of the system is diffeomorphic
to S^3, is there a periodic solution on this level set? In other
words, does the Seifert conjecture hold if the vector field comes from
a Hamiltonian system?  Rabinowitz showed that if the level set is
star-like, in other words every ray from the origin intersects it in
exactly one point, then the answer is yes.  The answer is not known
for a general level set.
</p><p>
Riemannian Geometry
</p><p>
In the case of Riemannian geometry, one version of the Seifert
conjecture is a question about closed geodesics. Namely, for a given
Riemannian metric on S^2, are there any closed geodesics? The unit
tangent bundle of S^2 is diffeomorphic to S^3, which means that a
geodesic flow on S^2 corresponds to a flow on S^3. A periodic orbit
for this flow in S^3 corresponds to a closed geodesic. In this very
restricted case, the Seifert conjecture does hold. Bangert and Franks
proved the much stronger result that every Riemannian metric on S^2
has infinitely many closed geodesics.
</p><p>
Topology
</p><p>
In the topological context, we generalize the question:
</p><p>
Generalized Seifert Question: Let M be a compact n-dimensional
manifold with Euler characteristic zero. This last condition
guarantees that there exist non-vanishing vector fields on M.  Does
every non-vanishing C^r vector field on M have a periodic orbit?
</p><p>
In 1966, W. Wilson showed that for a manifold described above of
dimension four or larger, the answer to this question is no for
arbitrarily smooth vector fields. In other words, Wilson found an
infinitely differentiable non-vanishing vector field on M which
contains no periodic orbits. I stated the result for S^3, but in fact
Kuperberg's example also shows that for any manifold as above of
dimension three, the answer to the Seifert question is no.
</p><p>
As the above discussion shows, the Seifert conjecture comes up in a
variety of fields. It is an exciting result that Kuperberg has
disproved it. In <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/forum/seifert/se2.html">part two of this article</a>, I
will give an outline of the ideas used Kuperberg's infinitely
differentiable counterexample.
