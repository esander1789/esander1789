</p><h1>Lotka-Volterra Equations Through Computer Visualization</h1>


The simplest model of population growth says that population increase
is proportional to the current population. However, this does not take
into account that there are limited resources. In addition, there may
be many species competing more or less successfully for these same
resources; some species may hunt others.  To begin to take these
factors into account, ecologists came up with the nonlinear model
given by the Lotka-Volterra equations. This model consists of a system
of ordinary differential equations for the rate of population growth
of n interacting species depending on the current population.

<p>

Using the Lotka-Volterra model, what happens to each species after a
long time? Does one species beat out the others and become the only
species left? Do the populations of the species remain constant? Mary
Lou Zeeman, mathematics professor at the University of Texas, San
Antonio and Drew LaMar, undergraduate at U.T. San Antonio, are looking at
this question of long term behavior using dynamical systems theory.
They recently visited the Geometry Center to use computer
visualization to gain some intuition. Here is some of the theory of
the Lotka-Volterra differential equations and a description of Zeeman
and LaMar's visualizations with accompanying figures.



</p><p>

We look at the populations of n species as a point in n-dimensional
space. The question of eventual behavior becomes a mathematical
question; starting at a given point in n-dimensional space, what is
the eventual behavior of the solution of the Lotka-Volterra
differential equations? This is an n-dimensional system with n^2+n
parameters. We wish to know how the dynamics change as the parameters
vary.

</p><p>

By practical considerations, the origin must be fixed by the
Lotka-Volterra flow, since zero population can never result in any
positive population; we restrict attention to the positive cone in
n-space. When species are strictly competitive, then work of
M.W. Hirsch shows that other than the origin, every orbit is
asymptotic to an invariant set called the carrying simplex.  This
carrying simplex is a hypersurface homeomorphic to the standard unit
simplex in n-space via radial projection. Thus, since the carrying
simplex is globally attracting, understanding the dynamics on it will
show the eventual behavior of every initial point.

</p><p>

There is at most one fixed point with all coordinates positive.  Call
this fixed point P. It lies on the carrying simplex. In some cases it
is known that there are no other recurrences except on the axes.  Mary
Lou Zeeman and Christopher Zeeman have proved that any time that the
carrying simplex is convex or weakly convex (i.e.  the carrying
simplex lies all to one side of it's the tangent plane at the fixed
point), there can be no periodic orbits, and the fixed point P is the
only recurrence off of the axes. In this case, if P is an unstable
fixed point, then ecologically, one species eventually dominates.

</p><p>

In some non-convex cases, it is known that there is a periodic orbit
on the carrying simplex. For example, M.L. Zeeman has proved that for
certain paths in parameter space, there is a Hopf bifurcation from the
fixed point P.

</p><p>

Zeeman and LaMar are investigating the transition from no periodic
orbit to a periodic orbit through a Hopf bifurcation. What happens to
the shape of the carrying simplex at the bifurcation? Does the Hopf
bifurcation occur immediately as the carrying simplex loses convexity,
or does the loss of convexity precede the periodic orbit? To gain
intuition, they have come up with a method for computing the carrying
simplex. They are animating the carrying simplex through a
Hopf bifurcation. Here are a series of pictures of the carrying
simplex for the three species case.

</p><p>

This figure shows the carrying simplex as the periodic point goes
through the Hopf bifurcation. Note that in the top picture, the
carrying simplex is concave, in the middle picture, the carrying
simplex is equal to the unit simplex, in the bottom picture, the
simplex is convex, and thus there are no periodic orbits.

Through a combination of dynamical systems theory and computer
visualization, Zeeman and LaMar are gaining intuition for the dynamics
of solutions to the Lotka-Volterra equations. Though the equations are
still very simplistic, understanding them gives insight into what
happens in a more complex situation.

This article is based on Zeeman's talk in the University of
Minnesota Dynamics and Mechanics Seminar on February 23, 1995, as well
as an additional interview with Zeeman and LaMar. Thank you to them
for their time taken for the interview, as well as preparing the
figures for this article.
