The following is a description of some of the models for the
hyperbolic plane. In order to understand the descriptions, refer to
the figures.  They may seem a bit strange. However, a result due to
Hilbert says that it is impossible to smoothly embed the hyperbolic
plane in Euclidean three-space using the usual Euclidean geometry.
(Technical note: In fact it is possible to have a C^1 embedding into
R^3, according to a 1955 construction of Nicolaas Kuiper, but
according to William Thurston, the result would be "incredibly
unwieldy, and pretty much useless in the study of the surface's
intrinsic geometry."[William Thurston, "Three Dimensional Geometry and
Topology," Geometry Center Preprint, 1991, p.43.]) Since there is no
such smooth embedding, any model of the hyperbolic plane has to use a
different geometry. In other words, we must redefine words like point,
line, distance, and angle in order to have a surface in which the
parallel postulate fails, but which still satisfies Euclid's
postulates 1-4 (stated in the previous article).  Here are brief
descriptions of three models:
</p><p>
Klein Model
</p><p>
In the Klein model of the hyperbolic plane, the "plane" is the unit
disk; in other words, the interior of the Euclidean unit circle. We
call Euclidean points the "points" for our model. We call the portions
of Euclidean lines which intersect the disk "lines." See the Klein
model in Figure 1. From the above, the model seems similar to
Euclidean space. However, there are differences; since we insist that
postulate 2 holds, which says that we can make every line infinitely
long, we must have a new description of "distance." We define the
"distance" between two points as follows: If (x,y) and (u,v) are the
Euclidean coordinates of two points, then the hyperbolic "distance"
between them in the Klein model is
arccosh{(1-xu-yv)/sqrt[(1-x^2-y^2)(1-u^2-v^2)]}.  Thus postulate 2
holds in this model, since the "distance" from any point in the disk
to the unit circle is infinite.  Also, the way we define "angles" in
the model is not the same as Euclidean definition of angles. To see
this, look at the regular pentagon in the Klein model in Figure 2. As
you can see, although all five of the "angles" are the same, the
Euclidean angles are not the same.

Upper Half Plane Model
</p><p>
The upper half plane model takes the Euclidean upper half plane as the
"plane."  Now the "lines" are portions of circles with their center on
the boundary, as shown in Figure 1. The "distance" between two points
with Euclidean coordinates (x,y) and (u,v) is
arccosh{1+[(x-u)^2+(y-v)^2]/2yv}. Thus the "distance" from any point
to the x-axis is infinite, ensuring that postulate 2 holds in this
model. Unlike the Klein model, "angles" are the same as Euclidean
angles. Remember, you have to draw tangents to the "lines" to
calculate the Euclidean angles. See Figures 1 and 2.

Poincare Model
</p><p>
In the Poincare model, the "plane" is the unit disk, and "points" are
Euclidean points.  "Lines" are portions of circles intersecting the
disk and meeting the boundary at right angles. The "distance" between
two points with coordinates z and w in the complex plane is: 2
arctanh{|(z-w)/(1-wz*)|}, where z* is the complex conjugate of z. Thus
as in the Klein model, the "distance" to the boundary of the disk is
infinite, and postulate 2 holds. Like the upper half plane model, the
"angles" for the model are the same as Euclidean angles. See Figures 1
and 2. Also compare the isometric octahedrons in Figure 3.

It is also possible to have higher dimensional hyperbolic spaces.
There is a Poincare model for three-dimensional hyperbolic space. In
this case the "space" is the unit sphere, "lines" are portions of
circles intersecting the boundary of the unit sphere at right angles,
and "planes" are portions of spheres which meet the unit sphere at
right angles. Figure 4 shows a regular icosahedron in this Poincare
model of 3D hyperbolic space:
