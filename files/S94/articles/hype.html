"The Elements," a 325 BC publication of Euclid, records Euclid's
principles of geometry. For many centuries, these principles remained
the fundamental basis of the study of geometry. There are five
postulates of particular importance:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>A straight line may be drawn from any point to any other point.
<p>
</p></li><li>The straight line may be produced to any length.
<p>
</p></li><li>Around any point as a center, a circle of any radius may be described.
<p>
</p></li><li>Any two right angles are equal.
<p>
</p></li><li>Given a line and a point not on the line, there is exactly one
line through the given point not intersecting the given line.[B]
</li></ol>
<p>
This fifth postulate, also called the parallel postulate, receives
special attention. Mathematicians did not like it because it possesses
a different character from the first four, being global rather than
local in nature. Since intersection of lines can take place at an
arbitrary distance, there is no way to actually check whether lines
intersect. Thus starting as soon as the 4th century AD, there were
attempts to prove that 5 follows from 1-4. All attempts to prove this
failed, since in fact the parallel postulate is independent of 1-4. It
was not until the middle of the 19th century that Bolyai and
Lobachevsky separately showed that in fact it is possible to
construct a consistent geometry in which the parallel postulate does
not hold. In this geometry, there are infinitely many non-intersecting
lines through a given point. It is called hyperbolic geometry.
</p><p>
Mathematicians found it difficult to accept hyperbolic geometry. In
the middle of the 19th century, most were unable to imagine or accept
any geometric system which did not fit with Euclid's principles. As an
indication, even Bolyai's father, a mathematician himself, was unable
to believe or understand the work of his son because of his belief in
the absolute truth of Euclidean geometry.[B]
</p><p>
Soon after the work of Bolyai and Lobachevsky, others constructed
models of hyperbolic geometry within Euclidean space. By renaming
certain geometric objects from Euclidean space as the lines and
circles, people developed systems in which all of Euclid's postulates
hold except that there were infinitely many non-intersecting lines,
violating the parallel postulate. These models, all isometric, verify
the existence of hyperbolic geometry.  As Courant and Robbins state in
"What is Mathematics," "This must, eo ipso, be just as consistent as
the original Euclidean geometry, because it is presented to us, seen
from another point of view and described with other words, as a body
of facts of ordinary Euclidean geometry."[C]
</p><p>
The modern approach to geometry is somewhat different from that of
"The Elements." However, a (geodesically complete Riemannian) geometry
on a surface is essentially a structure on the surface obeying the
modernized versions of postulates 1-4. Each surface has a
unique associated geometry locally isometric to the sphere, the plane,
or the hyperbolic plane. The sign of a special constant called the
Euler characteristic determines which of the three kinds of geometries
a surface possesses.  There is a complete classification of all
compact connected surfaces. By computing the Euler characteristic of all
these surfaces, one can draw an amazing conclusion; of these infinite
number of possible surfaces, only seven have non-negative curvature,
implying that all but seven are hyperbolic. For example, all n-holed
tori with n greater than 1 have an associated hyperbolic geometry. Among
the quite
common class of compact connected surfaces, a geometric structure that
took over a millennium to discover is overwhelmingly the most frequent.
</p><p>
Since every surface with a hyperbolic geometry is locally isometric to
the hyperbolic plane, the modern study of hyperbolic geometry involves
studying models for the hyperbolic plane which are embedded in
Euclidean space. I describe the properties of the Klein, Poincare, and
upper half plane
models with accompanying figures in the article
<a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/forum/hype/model.html">Models of the Hyperbolic Plane</a>.
</p><p>
Oliver Goodman, a postdoc at the Geometry Center, has written a
general-purpose hyperbolic geometry software package called
Hyperbolic.m. Operating within Mathematica, Hyperbolic.m allows the
user to manipulate hyperbolic objects (in any dimensional hyperbolic
space) such as points, lines, vectors, polyhedra, and other
structures. The user enters these structures within any of five
hyperbolic models. The package calculates angles and lengths for
vectors and distances between points, convert between different
models, and apply isometries. It also computes triangle groups.
Hyperbolic.m allows the user to display the results of manipulations
using Mathematica graphics. See the description of models referenced above,
 which
contains figures made with Hyperbolic.m.
</p><p>
Although there are several programs which, when combined, do what
Hyperbolic.m does, there are none that do everything. The package's
versatility allows the user to use only one program, and to take
advantage of other functions within Mathematica.

If you want a copy of this program, click to
<a href="ftp://ftp.geom.umn.edu/pub/software/hyperbolic.tar.Z">download hyperbolic.tar</a>.
Hyperbolic.m is also available by anonymous ftp from ftp.geom.umn.edu in the
file hyperbolic.tar.Z in the pub/software directory.
 Any questions or
comments on the package
should be sent to Goodman (oag@geom.umn.edu).
