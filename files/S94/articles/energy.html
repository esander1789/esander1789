</p><h1>Energies of Hopf Links</h1>

Rob Kusner of the University of Massachusetts and John Sullivan of the
University of Minnesota have been at the Geometry Center for the last
month to work on energy minimization in the study of knots and links.
Basically, minimal energy configurations are those for which parts of
the knot or link stay far apart. For example, an unknotted loop has as
its minimal energy a round circle. They hope that looking at energies
will give a way to distinguish between different knots and links.
</p><p>

A particularly nice class of links is the class Hopf links. These are
links composed of particular great circles on the three-sphere which
come from the Hopf fibration, defined as follows.  The three-sphere is
embedded in four-space. Regarding four-space as complex two-space,
Hopf circles are the intersection of the sphere and the complex linear
subspaces (two-dimensional real subspaces). Equivalently, they are
points on the three-sphere such that the ratio of the two complex
coordinates is constant. Hopf circles turn out to be great circles of
the three-sphere. In fact, each point on the three-sphere is contained
in exactly one Hopf circle. This division into Hopf circles is called
the Hopf fibration.  Any two Hopf circles link exactly once. (Their
linking number is +1, giving the circles the same orientation as the
complex linear subspaces in which they lie.)  Thus a collection of
Hopf circles form a link.
</p><p>

For Hopf links, the associated energy depends only on the distance
between loops in four-space, since each loop in the link is itself a
round circle.  The energy Kusner and Sullivan use is proportional to
one over the square of the distance.  However, it is not necessary to
work with the three-sphere in four-space to compute this quantity; for
each Hopf circle, there is a uniquely defined point on the two-sphere.
This is the point on the Riemann sphere given by the constant ratio of
the two complex coordinates for points on a Hopf circle. Minimizing
the associated energy for configurations of points on the two-sphere
is equivalent to looking at the original energy function for Hopf
links on the three-sphere.
</p><p>

The associated energy function for points on the two-sphere turns out
to be the same as the classical Coulomb's law energy between charged
particles, in other words, inversely proportional to the distances
between points in three-space. Some classical physics papers discuss
the energy minimization problem of point charges on a sphere.
However, work on the problem stopped around 1912 due to the discovery
of quantum mechanics.

Here are the first four particle minimal energy configurations; for
two particles, antipodal points have minimal energy. Assuming that
they are at the north and south poles, the corresponding link consists
of loops which are the intersections of the three-sphere with the
(z,0)- and the (0,w)-complex lines. For three points, the minimum
energy occurs when the three are evenly spaced on a great circle of
the sphere. Four points have minimum energy when placed in a regular
tetrahedron, but there is another critical configuration; can you find
it?  The minimum energy configurations are known for up to six
particles. For larger numbers of points, little is known about
critical configurations and the number of stable configurations (local
minima). Last summer Kusner and Sullivan discovered, using Ken
Brakke's program Surface Evolver, that there are two different stable
configurations of sixteen particles. One appears to be the global
minimum; the other has slightly more energy. Kusner and Sullivan are
currently using Morse theory to try to classify all the critical
configurations of charges on the sphere up through sixteen particles.
