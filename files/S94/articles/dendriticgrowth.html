In a solution of liquid or gas at approximately the
temperature of solidification which contains a small
crystal. What shape forms as the crystal  continues to
grow? For example, how do ice crystals form in a container
of water or in a cloud? One possibility is the creation of
dendrites, objects such as snowflakes with complex
spiny structure, as pictured in the figures. (The
figures are all made
by Andy Roosen.)
</p><p>
The boundary between liquid and crystal has two main
governing forces on it;  first, there is the  energy of
surface tension. This means that there is a tendency for
the area of the surface  of the crystal  to decrease.
Therefore the rate of solidification depends on the
curvature of the surface. the cold temperature of the
liquid means that it has a tendency to freeze. However,
the process of  freezing liquid produces a latent heat of
fusion. Thus every time freezing takes place in some
area, the solution surrounding the area gets warmer and
less likely to freeze further until the heat has diffused
throughout the liquid.
</p><p>
As a result of the force of temperature, if there is a small
bump on a crystal, the heat of fusion near the bump
diffuses quicker since it is protruding into the liquid,
thereby increasing the rate at which crystal forms. If
the only force on a crystal was the temperature, these
bumps in the crystal would become arbitrarily thin.
However, since there is also surface tension, the bumps
stay a finite thickness. Since in a natural physical
system there is always noise, there are always enough
small perturbations to make the spiny structure
characteristic for dendrites.

This week at the Geometry Center, a group of researchers
known as the Minimal Surfaces Team has convened with the
object of studying dendrites. Formed five years ago, the
team meets at the Center to work on the mathematics of
minimal surfaces. Although Jean Taylor of Rutgers
University and Fred Almgren of Princeton University are
the only remaining members from the original team, the
aim remains the same. This year the eight members of the
team come from a variety of universities, as well as from
the National Institute of Standards and Technology
(N.I.S.T.). They are  studying  the precise growth
methods of dendrites as described above. The interest is
both theoretical and practical; the study of dendrites
has applications in areas such as metallurgy.
</p><p>
Starting with basic assumptions about the laws
governing the dendritic growth, the members work on
applying computational and mathematical techniques. I
talked to Almgren as well as Andy Roosen, a researcher
from N.I.S.T.  Each told me about the particular aspects
of dendrites that they are studying. Here is a brief
description of their research.
</p><p>
To date, most of the research about dendrites has been
about smooth two-dimensional objects. Almgren has
extended the results to a three-dimensional model. It
was a challenge to create a practical three-dimensional
algorithm because the model of crystal growth is so
costly in terms of time and storage. In order to conserve
these quantities, he used a special efficient partition
of the space.
</p><p>
A standard method to partition space is to use an evenly spaced
three-dimensional grid. However, it is not necessary to have this kind
of precision far away from the crystal, since there will only be large
changes near the interface of solution and crystal. Almgren's method
is to divide the space in large blocks far from the crystal and finer
blocks close to the crystal. Since the structure is constantly
changing, it is necessary to repartition the space at every step.
Almgren has worked on this with Princeton graduate students Nung Kwan
Yip and David Caraballo and Rutgers undergraduate student Sharon
Caraballo. Together they have constructed a practical algorithm to
accomplish the repartition.
</p><p>
Roosen works on another generalization of the smooth
planar case: rather than extending the dimension of the
dendrites, he studies dendrites which are not smooth.
Starting with some work of Taylor on faceted dendrites,
Roosen has incorporated temperature effects. He
restricts the crystal boundary to a limited number of
possible directions; in other words, the boundary
consists of straight lines, and these lines can only have
certain specified directions.
</p><p>
Using the restriction  of linear sides in a limited number
of directions, Roosen imposes a change in temperature
across a side. Experimentally, it is known that a flat
side with a temperature change along it will not remain
flat; it will break into segments.  Roosen has
constructed a model of this behavior. He determine
mathematically where the model will break into several
linear segments. The model appears physically
accurate.
</p><p>
One interesting point about the theoretical model is
that  if the grid is too fine, the model it fails to produce
the spiny structures always seen with actual dendrites.
In other words, in order to model the physical system, one
must either be inaccurate or reintroduce noise. It is the
noise which characterizes the system. See figures 1 and 3.
</p><p>
The study of dendrites is of important practical use as well as
interesting mathematics. It is most intriguing after seeing some of
the pictures. Thus there are six figures to accompany the article.
Although not all of them have been described specifically in the
article, the captions should be sufficiently descriptive to make them
worth a look.

The figures are located in the pictures/articles/dendritic.growth
directory on the Geometry Forum (forum.swarthmore.edu). To get them,

Figures (by Andy Roosen):
</p><p>
Figure 1
A "frilly" computation that has a lot of numerical
noise because it was on a coarse temperature grid and a low
surface energy.
</p><p>
<img src="dendriticgrowth_files/fig1.gif">
</p><p>
Figure 2
A "boring" computation on a fine temperature grid.
Notice that no side-branches appeared.
</p><p>
<img src="dendriticgrowth_files/fig2.gif">
</p><p>
Figure 3
An effort to reintroduce side branches by perturbing
the velocities of edges depending on their distance from
the center. In this and the previous figure, several
interface positions at various times are shown.
</p><p>
<img src="dendriticgrowth_files/fig3.gif">
</p><p>
Figure 4
A computation different from the others: instead of
moving each edge by the average temperature along it, an
edge is moved by the low temperature along it. notice that
the dendrite is much more blocky. It really appears
crystalline.
</p><p>
<img src="dendriticgrowth_files/fig4.gif">
</p><p>
Figures 5 and 6
Two computations in which perturbations were
introduced by regularly raising the temperature at the
tip of the dendrites a bit (imagine a laser repeatedly
shining on the tip of the dendrite). Color (in figure 6
only) indicates temperature with redder = hotter and
bluer = colder. The temperature ranges from -.5 to 0 with 0
as the melting temperature, and the latent heat of fusion
is 1.  Press on the icons to see these figures:
