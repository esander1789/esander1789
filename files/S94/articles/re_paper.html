</p><h1>Research Paper on the Web!?</h1>

Recently, I talked with Geometry Center postdoc Davide Cervone about
his multimedia research paper,
<a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/locate/RP2-handle/"> A Tight Polyhedral
Immersion of the Real Projective Plane with one Handle</a>.  The
paper is easy to read, and I couldn't do any better explaining it
than the author does  himself.  The purpose of this article is to
discuss the format of Davide's paper, the problems associated with
writing a paper in this form, and the general issues of having
research papers available in this form.<p>

To begin with, I encourage you to look at this paper.  Even if you have
little understanding of what most of the words in the title mean, it is
very self-explanatory and worth diving into.  This paper was NOT written
like a regular research paper; that is, a paper sparsely written with
only the barest of definitions in a linear format.  Papers like these are
the stuff of printed journals, which usually only experts on the subject
can read through without a reference book on hand.  Unlike those in
traditional formats, this paper is non-linear and uses many of the
advantages a hypertext format has to offer.  First off, with almost every
mathematical term, Davide created a link to a definition of that term.
For instance if the reader follows the link for the phrase: "Euler
Characteristic" the following definition comes up:</p><p>

</p><dl><dt><dfn>Euler Characteristic</dfn>

</dt><dd>The Euler characteristic of a closed surface is a topological
    invariant that can be computed in several ways.  Two important
    ones are by counting critical points (the Euler characteristic
    is the number of maxima and minima minus the number of saddles)
    and by counting vertices, edges and faces of a polyhedral surface
    (the Euler characteristic is the number of vertices and faces
    minus the number of edges).<p>

    The Euler characteristic is a fundamental value: this number
    uniquely classifies closed surfaces up to orientability. That is,
    given the Euler characteristic and orientability of a surface, the
    topological type of the surface is determined. This makes the
    Euler characteristic a powerful computational tool.
</p></dd></dl>

Besides including links to definitions of words, Davide also has links
tied to entire sentences.  If a reader wants further explanation of a
particular sentence, they need only to follow the link at the end of a
sentence.<p>

For instance, in the section of the paper describing the history of the
problem, one finds the sentence:</p><p>

</p><dl><dt></dt><dd>Every non-orientable surface with Euler characteristic strictly
     less than -1 admits a tight immersion into three-space.
</dd></dl>

Following the link at the end of the sentence brings up a page containing
this explanation:<p>

</p><dl><dt><dfn>Tight Non-Orientable Surfaces</dfn>

</dt><dd>The non-orientable surfaces are divided into two families, one formed by
    adding handles to the Klein bottle, the other by adding handles to the
    real projective plane (just as all the orientable surfaces can be formed
    by adding handles to a sphere). The surfaces based on the Klein bottle
    have even Euler characteristic, and those based on the projective plane
    have odd Euler characteristic ...
</dd></dl>

One great advantage of a paper like this is that it can be read by people
at many different levels of understanding the subject.  Experts in the
field can go through the many points of the article without having to
read through definitions and theorems they are familiar with, while a
novice has the opportunity to go though the paper without needing additional
reference books to understand the document.<p>

Besides including references for the terms, Davide also includes historical
references that give a better background of the original formulation of
the problem and the work that has been done on it.   Again, this gives the
novice or curious reader a chance to gain further information on the subject
without having to delve for further references in the library.</p><p>

Information available at the fingertips is nice, but what else is there?
Another thing Davide has included is movies and still images of the
polyhedral surface and its level sets.  Some web browsers may not be able
to display these images, but by including a range of different formats,
Davide has insured that a majority of people will be able to view at
least one of them.  These images are valuable because they enable the
user to get a clearer understanding of the immersion by having many
different pictures to view.</p><p>

Reading through Davide's paper many potential problems came to mind
about writing articles in a hypertext format and in particular the
HTML format.  For those of you unfamiliar with HTML (Hyper Text Markup
Language) it is a text language used to write many of the documents on
the Web.  It is a simple language that allows the writer to insert
hyperlinks to pictures and other documents with ease within the
original document.  It is a powerful tool since it does not take too
long to learn, and anyone can write a work in hypertext after a short
time.  However there are some drawbacks. One of its problems involves
mathematical formulae.  In HTML it is not easy to include documents in
mathematical formats such as Tex, LaTex, or AMS-Tex.  To solve this
problem, Davide kept mathematical formula to a minimum and made most
of the formula he did use into pictures, which were included into the
document so that they appear to be part of the text.  Also it is
difficult to combine formula with text within the same line.  There is
software available that allows one to include formula in text, but
Davide chose not to use this because its results are not that good.
This is a minor issue, but an issue that should be addressed and
solved because computer technology should allow the easy manipulation
of formula.</p><p>

Another difficulty lies in writing up definitions to the terms.  This was
not a mentally difficult task, just time-consuming.  Davide believes that
in the future a database of glossary items will be available so that a
writer will only need to create a link to the database, instead of having
to write one up herself.</p><p>

Some problems I was not aware of involved pictures.  A user that changes the
size of the type-say for easier readability-will find that the pictures next
to this larger type do not change in size.  The result can be to have some
awkward looking pictures.</p><p>

These format problems are minor; I doubt that many people will be distracted
by these small problems.  However these are issues people should be aware of
if they desire to emulate Davide's work and write articles in a hypertext
format.</p><p>

With the hypertext format, there are some new issues that will need to be
addressed, such as:  How will the user know that an article is authentic?
How will they be able to access it?  How much (if any) should the access
costs be?  Should the traditional linear paper form be kept?  Should the
writer be allowed to make revisions to the article even after it is posted?
Some of the problems of authenticity, access, and cost are issues that are
carried over from the traditional bound journal format, and probably will be
addressed in the same fashion as they are in the original format.  The
issues as to whether an article must remain in a static form, and its form
in general are a matter of much debate.  As for Davide's paper, he has made
some revisions since the original posting, and has marked each page with a
date so that the reader will know when it has been last updated.</p><p>

As I mentioned at the beginning of this article,
<a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/locate/RP2-handle/">Davide's paper</a> is a
wonderful work and I encourage everyone to take a look at it.  A
hypertext format like this will probably become commonplace in the
near future, so it is exciting to see it today and to watch this
format grow and develop.</p><p>
