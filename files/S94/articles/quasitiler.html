</p><h1>QuasiTiler: New software to create quasiperiodic tilings of the plane</h1>
<p>
geometry.college, geometry.forum, Tue, 18 Jan 1994
</p><p>

Penrose tilings are a beautiful nonperiodic tilings of the plane using
only two different rhombi. They have a variety of applications. For
example, they arise in the study of quasicrystals; see Evelyn Sander,
"<a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/forum/quasicrystals/">Quasicrystals</a>," geometry.college,
November 15, 1993. The tilings have
a rich mathematical structure: Despite their nonperiodicity, they
exhibit five-fold symmetry, obey certain strict matching rules, and
only allow for a finite number of different ways to put the two tiles
together. They also have the property of quasiperiodicity; namely,
given any pattern in the tiling, there is an R&gt;0 such that it is
possible to find a repeat of the pattern within any ball of radius R.

In 1982 N.G. de Bruijn showed that all Penrose tilings of the plane
result from the projection of part of a five-dimensional lattice onto
a plane. In fact, by specifying the "slope" and "offset" in five
dimensions of the plane upon which to project, one can specify a
tiling. If this plane is invariant under five-fold rotation about the
body diagonal of the unit cube, and if we chose carefully which
part of the lattice is projected, then the tiling is a Penrose tiling.
</p><p>
More specifically, we start with the five-dimensional integer lattice
and its connecting 2-facets. Pick a plane E upon which we will project
facets and points from the lattice to create the tiling. We choose E
orthogonal to the line through the body diagonal of the unit cube.
Here is how we decide which are the allowed vertices in the tiling of
E: Project the unit cube into the three-dimensional orthogonal
complement of E. The resulting object is a rhombic icosahedron which
we call K. The allowed vertices are exactly those which land inside K
under projection, and the allowed facets are those for which all four
associated vertices are allowed. Our restrictions on E and allowed
vertices forbid overlaps and gaps in the tiling.

Eugenio Durand, a Geometry Center programmer, has written the program
QuasiTiler to find the described quasiperiodic tilings of the plane.
He originally wrote it to help Marjorie Senechal with her work on
quasicrystals. The program allows the user to specify the "slope" of
the plane E, using a mouse to modify a picture of the five-dimensional
unit cube.  There are three degrees of freedom for the offset of the
plane. The user uses three sliders to change the offset. One of the
offset directions specifies whether the tiling is a Penrose tiling.
The program then shows the tiling that the user has specified. In
addition, the user may specify a lattice dimension other than five.
It is an easy program to use, and the results are beautiful.

QuasiTiler runs on Next machines. It is available by anonymous ftp in
the /u/ftp/pub directory of ftp.geom.umn.edu.  Try the

the approach used in QuasiTiler:
