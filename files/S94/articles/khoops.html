</p><h1>How to Fill <i>n</i>-Dimensional Space with Hoops</h1>

A geometric circle in R^3 is the set of points in a fixed plane that
lie a fixed positive distance from a center point that lies in the
same plane.  (Notice that "circle" refers to the curve, and not to the
disk it bounds.) In my posting and followup <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/forum/hoops_links/circle.html">
"Circle Puzzle,"</a> (geometry.college, geometry.puzzles, November 28,
1994), I explained a way to fill all of R^3 with disjoint geometric
circles. It is discontinuous; i.e. the map from each point on by a
particular circle to the triple (center, normal, radius) is not a
continuous map. It is not hard to show, using algebraic topology, that
it is impossible to fill all of R^3 continuously with disjoint
geometric circles.

</p><p>

Geometric circles of unit radius are called hoops.  Using the Axiom of
Choice, J.H. Conway and H.T. Croft showed that it is nevertheless
possible to discontinuously fill three-space using disjoint hoops.
However, Daniel Asimov has shown that using continuous families of
disjoint hoops, it is not possible to fill a region of infinite
volume.

</p><p>

This article describes research results of Daniel Asimov, of NASA Ames
Research Center in Mountain View, California. It gives an example of
an open region in three-space continuously filled with hoops. It then
explains the higher dimensional generalizations of continuous families
of hoops.



</p><p>

It is possible to use hoops to continuously fill an open solid torus
of revolution in R^3 with the two generating circles both of radius
one; Dan Asimov refers to this region as a "bialy", after the bread
like a bagel with the hole in the middle having "radius zero." The
configuration of hoops on each torus is called the "circles of
Villarceau," after the French mathematician who first discovered them
in 1848.

</p><p>

In order to set up the generalization to higher dimensions, this
description of the circles of Villarceau uses the stereographic
projection of the Hopf fibration of the three-sphere. In a previous
article, I described this same configuration of hoops in a less
technical manner.  See <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/forum/hoops_links/hoops1.html">"Hoops in
three-space,"</a> geometry.college, geometry.research, June 9, 1993,
For more details, see Asimov's paper

</p><p>

The Hopf fibration of the three-sphere is the division of the
three-sphere into certain great circles, called Hopf circles, in such
a way that each point is on exactly one Hopf circle. Precisely,
consider the three-sphere embedded in four-space; use pairs of complex
numbers to specify points in four-space. The Hopf circles are the
intersections of the complex one-dimensional linear subspaces with the
three-sphere. A complex one-dimensional linear subspace is the same
idea as a real one-dimensional linear subspace, except that all the
numbers are complex. Namely, for fixed complex z and w, a linear
subspace containing (z,w) is {(b*z,b*w): b varies over all complex
numbers}. For more about the Hopf fibration, see the description in
<a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/forum/hoops_links/energy.html">"Energies of Hopf Links,"</a> geometry.college,
June 17, 1994.  For pictures of Hopf fibrations, also see

A stereographic projection from the three-sphere to R^3 is analogous
to stereographic projection from the two-sphere to the
plane. Stereographic projection preserves circles and lines. Thus
projections of the Hopf circles are circles, except the circle
throught the projection point, which projects to a line and a point at
infinity. Since we know that the Hopf circles fill up the
three-sphere, we know that stereographic projection of the Hopf
fibration fills three-space.  Precisely, it gives a foliation of R^3
minus the z-axis by nested tori. Each individual torus consists of
geometric circles of a single radius; each of the geometric circles
wrap around the torus once in each generating direction.

</p><p>

In order to get hoops rather than geometric circles of different
radii, we apply a uniform shrinking to each individual torus. In order
to preserve continuity, nearby tori from the Hopf fibration are shrunk
by close shrinking constants. By choosing the shrinking constants
wisely, after shrinking each torus, we get another series of nested
tori filled now by hoops.  The new nested tori all have one of the two
generators equal to the unit circle in the xy-plane with the origin as
center. The second generating circles of the new nested tori have
distinct radii, including every non-negative number less than one.
Thus the disjoint hoops comprising the new tori are a continuous way to
fill the open bialy.

halfway through the solid bialy.

the one torus.

What happens in higher dimensions? Define a k-hoop in N-space to be
the set of points in a (k+1)-dimensional plane (not necessarily
containing the origin) that lie a unit distance from a point that lies
in the same (k+1)-dimensional plane. A k-hoop might also be described
as a "unit geometric k-sphere."

</p><p>

Now we let N = 2k+1. Is it possible to continuously fill up a region
of (2k+1)-space with disjoint k-hoops? The answer is yes for k = 0, 1,
3, and 7; the filling can be done using the (2k+1)-dimensional
analogue of the stereographic projection of the Hopf fibration,
followed by uniform shrinking on each S^k x S^k "torus" (similar to
the three-dimensional case). That there are such Hopf fibrations is
related to the fact that division algebras over the real numbers are
possible only in dimensions 1, 2, 4, and 8, as exemplified by the
reals (R), complexes (C), quaternions (H), and octonions (O).

</p><p>

Surprisingly, Asimov has shown that the dimensions k = 0, 1, 3, and 7,
for which one can construct (2k+1)-bialys, are the only dimensions for
which an open set in R^(2k+1) can be continuously filled by k-hoops.

</p><p>

Here is a table of volumes of the (2k+1)-bialys described above. Just
as in the three-dimensional case, there is a finite bound on the
volume of the region filled continuously in higher
dimensions. However, it is not known whether these are the largest
volumes in these dimensions which can be continuously filled by
k-hoops, with the exception of the case k = 0, where 4 is clearly the
maximum.

</p><p>
</p><pre>Dimension k of the hoops     Volume of the (2k+1)-bialy

       0                                 4
       1                                 2*pi^2
       3                                 pi^4
       7                                 (pi^8)/72
</pre>
<p>


Using a cartesian product with any R^n, these examples of k-hoops
foliating an open set in R^(2k+1) immediately lead to examples where
an open set in R^(2k+1+n) is foliated by k-hoops for any n &gt;= 0.
Other cases are not yet known.  For example, it is unknown whether an
open set in R^6 can be foliated by 2-hoops (geometric 2-spheres of
unit radius in R^6).
