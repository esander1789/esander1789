</p><h1>Two Solutions to the Circle Puzzle</h1>

The following are solutions to the puzzle in the previous document <a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/forum/hoops_links/circle.html">Circle Puzzle.</a>

In the entire solution, when I say circle, I mean geometric circle.

</p><p>

With center (x,y,z) = (1/2,0,0), place circles in the xy-plane of
radii .5, 1.5, 2.5, ..., i.e. at radius n+0.5, where n is nonnegative
integer.

</p><p>

Notice that a sphere of any radius centered at (0,0,0) either
intersects one of the above circles at two points, or has a point of
tangency to each of two of the above circles. Remove from each sphere
centered at (0,0,0) the two points that are already on circles. These
punctured spheres need to be covered with additional circles.

</p><p>

Here is how to cover each of the above twice-punctured spheres with
disjoint circles. Place tangent planes to the two removed points. If
the planes are parallel, the two points are like the north and south
poles of a globe, and you can cover the rest of the sphere with
circles of latitude. If the tangent planes are not parallel, they
intersect in a line. Call this line the "hinge line." The intersection
of the sphere with any plane containing this hinge line is a circle
(as long as it is non-empty). In addition, since a line and a point
not on the line determine a plane, every point on the sphere is on a
unique plane containing the hinge line. Thus this covers each
twice-punctured sphere by disjoint circles.

</p><p>

The disjoint union of the circles on the xy-plane with center
(1/2,0,0) and radius n+0.5 along with the above twice-punctured
spheres is all of R^3.  Thus all of R^3 is covered with disjoint
geometric circles.

Thanks to Dan Asimov for telling me about this puzzle and solution. It
is discussed in the following book:

 Mathematical Association of America, 1991.

</p><h2>Oliver Goodman's Solution</h2>

Here is another solution to the circle puzzle by
Oliver Goodman (oag@mundoe.maths.mu.oz.au):
Take an open spherical ball. Remove a circle of half the radius going through
the center and one pole. The intersection of a plane perpendicular to
the removed circle and going through the pole is an open disk minus
a point. Open disk minus a point can be made out of circles. Since all
these open disks minus a point are disjoint we can make the open ball
minus a circle out of circles. Putting back the circle we get an open
ball plus a point. Join copies of these pole to pole along a line like
a string of beads. So now we have exactly covered the union of a line
and a collection of touching open balls. Fill the remaining space with
circles centered on and perpendicular to the line.
