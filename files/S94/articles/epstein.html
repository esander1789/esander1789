"I have been interested in teaching for a long time. For many years I
was worried about the ineffectiveness of my teaching. My sister was a
primary school teacher and is now a lecturer in sociology. She has
always complained to me about the quality of mathematics teaching at
university. The problem was I never knew what to do about it," says
David Epstein, professor of mathematics at Warwick University in
England. "I first saw how I could improve my teaching at a summer
course two years ago at the Geometry Center."
<p>
"The course instructors were all famous mathematicians: John Conway,
Bill Thurston, Peter Doyle, and Jane Gilman. The students ranged in age
from 15 to 65. Many of them were high school students. Some of them
were famous research mathematicians. However, despite their diverse
backgrounds, everyone learned something.
</p><p>
"The class consisted of discussion and problem solving; there were no
formal lectures. Through unusual presentation techniques, the
instructors managed to present some quite advanced mathematics usually
first encountered at the graduate level. For example, to describe
curvature of a torus, they made use of peelings from potatos. We often
made models and cut objects out of paper."
</p><p>
"The Geometry Center summer course inspired me to try to improve my
own teaching. I have been trying some new techniques with a course on
metric spaces at Warwick. The students are polarized on whether they
like the outcome. The unusual format of the class means they have to
work harder. Some of them do not like this, but others have told
members of the department to make their classes as hard as mine. In
general I think it is good for the students. The course is in its
third year, and it improves each time."
</p><p>
Here are some of the teaching techniques in Epstein's class: Despite
having approximately 160 students, Epstein uses a discussion format
rather than a formal lecture style. In addition, Epstein attempts to
concentrate on understanding rather than tests. To this end, in past
years he has tried giving a variety of extra credit questions, with
monetary awards for those who have answered the most extra questions
correctly. Epstein plans to continue his tradition of giving out
examples of all the standard errors made on past tests and making the
students work out flaws in the reasoning.
</p><p>
This year, the most important change in Epstein's class is the
syllabus; "I like to annoy my collegues by pointing out that our
syllabus design is based on a never ending process; we always design a
course as a fundamental building block for more advanced courses. We
never reach a goal. Using a technique explained to me by Regine
Douady, an expert in elementary education, this year my class has a
syllabus different from any book on metric spaces.  The students start
with a list of problems which they can understand and attempt before
the class begins.  However, solving these questions is quite difficult
without some powerful theory. The object of the class is to design the
tools necessary to answer these problems. This means that there is
motivation for the material. When they see the key to solving one of
the problems, it is a relief and often a surprize."

class. Though some problems involve quite advanced material, they are
definitely worth trying. If anyone has further questions about the
course, email to David Epstein at dbae@geom.umn.edu
