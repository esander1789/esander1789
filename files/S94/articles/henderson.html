</p><h1>Mike Henderson's Implicit Surface Algorithm</h1>

<p>


A standard objective in computational mathematics is to graph an
implicitly defined surface. Here is a geometric description of a
practical but conceptually elegant continuation algorithm written by
Mike Henderson of IBM.

</p><p>
Given a point of an implicitly defined surface with full rank
Jacobian, the implicit function theorem guarantees that there is some
neighborhood in the tangent space that maps into the surface in a
bijective manner. In Riemannian geometry, this map is called the
exponential map. Starting with a point on the surface, Henderson's
algorithm computes the exponential map in a small elliptic region in
the tangent space using many applications of Newton's method. Figure 1
shows a (light yellow) region of the surface x^2+y^2-z=0 computed
starting from the (dark blue) tangent plane shown in Figure 2.

Starting with the computed region on the surface, the algorithm picks
a point on the boundary. It computes the exponential map to the
surface mapping into a small neighborhood of this point.  Since the
point is on the boundary of the computed region, the exponential map
always gives new information on the surface. Figure 3 shows two
overlapping elliptic regions on the surface from Figure 1.

We want the algorithm to keep repeating the process in the previous
paragraph until it has computed the entire surface. (intersected with
a compact region) However, in order to get new information each time,
the algorithm must identify the overlap between the boundary of the
new region and the boundary of the previously computed region. This
overlap is interior to the entire computed region, namely the union of
the old and new regions. To avoid unnecessary calculation, the
algorithm must remove this overlap from consideration before finding a
new boundary point.  Finding and removing the overlap is the most
computationally difficult part of using Henderson's method. After
this, the algorithm repeats the process in the previous paragraph.
This entire procedure continues to repeat as often as necessary until
the algorithm finds no more boundary points, at which time it has
finished computing the surface. Figure 4 shows the computed part of
the surface in Figure 1 after repeating the entire procedure several
times.

There are many applications for such an algorithm. Here is a
description of a problem from fluid dynamics called the Taylor-Couette
convection problem. Start with two cylinders, one inside the other;
put fluid between them. Keep the outside cylinder fixed; spin the
inside cylinder. When the rate of spin is sufficiently slow, the fluid
just spins slowly around; this is called Couette flow. More precisely,
Couette flow is characterized by saying that the fluid velocity along
the axis of the cylinders is zero and the fluid velocity in the radial
direction is also zero.

</p><p>

Since the outside cylinder does not move, fluid moves more slowly at
the outside edge. As the spin rate increases, centrifugal force throws
the faster moving fluid at the inside cylinder outwards. This results
in a rolling or convection of the fluid in the radial direction.  At
the bifurcation point at which the fluid ceases to move in Couette
flow, two possible kinds of motion can occur together or separately;
one possibility is that the fluid moves around two torus-shaped
regions around the cylinder; that is, a cross section of fluid moves
around two circles in the radial direction.  This is what is called a
two-convection cell.  Another possible fluid motion is a
four-convection cell; in other words, the fluid moves radially in four
circles in the cross section.

</p><p>

Near the bifurcation point from Couette flow, two- and four-cells
coexist with different amplitudes, depending on the height and the
spin rate of the inside cylinder. To study the bifurcation point, it
is informative to plot the amplitudes of the two- and four-cells as a
function of the height of the cylinders and the velocity of the inner
cylinder.  This information is given implicitly using the
Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow.  This is an example of a
2-dimensional surface in 4-dimensional space.

</p><p>

Figure 5 is a picture of a projection of this surface as computed by
Henderson's algorithm. He considers the specific situation of
infinitely long cylinders such that the flow periodic in the direction
along the axis. The aspect ratio is the ratio of the height of the
cylinders to the distance between the two cylinders. The Reynolds
number is a non-dimensional way of measuring the speed of the inner
cylinder. Namely,

</p><p>

    R= (angular velocity of inner cylinder)*(radius of inner cylinder)*
                            (distance between cylinders)/viscosity

This article is based on Henderson's talk in the University of
Minnesota Dynamics and Mechanics seminar on February 2, 1995.  I would
like to thank him for providing additional advice, as well as
preparing the figures for this article.
