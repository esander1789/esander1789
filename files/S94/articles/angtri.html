</p><h1>Angle Trisection</h1>

Most people are familiar from high school geometry with compass and
straightedge constructions.  For instance I remember being taught how to
bisect an angle, inscribe a square into a circle among other
constructions.
<p>

A few weeks ago I explained my job to a group of professors visiting the
Geometry Center .  I mentioned that I wrote articles on a
newsgroup about geometry and that sometimes people write to me with
geometry questions. For instance one person wrote asking whether it was
possible to divide a line segment into any ratio, and also whether it was
possible to trisect an angle.   In response to the first question I
explained how to find two-thirds of a line segment.  I answered the second
question by saying it was impossible to trisect an angle with a straightedge
and a compass, and gave the person a reference to some modern algebra
books as well as an article Evelyn Sander wrote about
<a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/forum/square_circle/">squaring the circle</a>.
One professor I told this story to replied by saying, "Bob it is possible to
trisect an angle."  Before I was able to respond to this shocking statement
he added, "You just needed to use a MARKED straightedge and a compass."  The
professor was referring to Archimedes' construction for trisecting an angle
with a marked straightedge and compass.
</p><p>

When someone mentions angle trisection I immediately think of trying to
trisect an angle via a compass and straightedge.  Because this is impossible
I rule out any serious discussion of the manner.  Maybe I'm the only one
with this flaw in thinking, but I believe many mathematicians make this same
serious mistake.
</p><p>

Why tell people it is impossible to trisect an angle via straightedge and
compass?  Instead we could say it is possible to trisect an angle, just not
with a straightedge and a compass.  When told that it is impossible to
trisect an angle with a straightedge and compass people then often believe
it is impossible to trisect an angle.  I think this is a mistake and to
rectify my previous error I will now give two methods for trisecting an
angle.  For both methods pictures are included that will hopefully
illuminate the construction.
</p><p>

The first method, Archimedes' trisection of an angle using a marked
straightedge has been described on the Geometry Forum before by John Conway.
First take the angle to be trisected, angle ABC, and construct a line
parallel to BC at point A.
</p><p>

</p><p>
Next use the compass to create a circle of radius AB centered at A.
</p><p>
<img src="angtri_files/fig2.gif">
</p><p>
 Now comes the part where the
marked straightedge is used.  Mark on the straightedge the length between A
and B.  Take the straightedge and line it up so that one edge is fixed at the
point B.  Let D be the point of intersection between the line from A parallel
to BC.  Let E be the point on the newly named line BD that intersects with
the circle.  Move the marked straightedge until the line BD satisfies the
condition AB = ED, that is adjust the marked straightedge until point E and
point D coincide with the marks made on the straightedge.
</p><p>
<img src="angtri_files/fig3.gif">
</p><p>
Now that BD is found, the angle is trisected,
that is 1/3*ANGLE ABC = ANGLE DBE.  To see this is true let angle DBC = a.
First of all since AD and BC are parallel, angle ADB = angle DBC = a.  Since
AE = DE, angle EAD = a, and so angle AED = Pi-2a.  So angle AEB = 2a, and
since AB = AE, angle ABE = 2a.  Since angle ABE + angle DBC = angle ABC, and
angle ABE = 2a, angle DBC = a.  Thus angle ABC is trisected.
</p><p>
<img src="angtri_files/fig4.gif">
</p><p>
The next method does not use a marked ruler, but instead uses a
curve called the Quadratrix of Hippias.  This method not only
allows one to trisect an angle, but enables one to partition an angle into
any fraction desired by use of a special curve called the Quadratrix of
Hippias.  This curve can be made using a computer or graphing calculator
and the idea for its construction is clever.  Let A be an angle varying
from 0 to Pi/2 and y=2*A/Pi.  For instance when A = Pi/2, y=1, and when A=0,
y=0.  Plot the horizontal line y = 2*A/Pi and the angle A on the same graph.
Then we will get an intersection point for each value of A from 0 to Pi/2.
</p><p>
<img src="angtri_files/fig5.gif">
</p><p>
This collection of intersection points is
our curve, the Quadratrix of Hippias.  We will now trisect the angle AOB.
First find the point where the line AO intersects with the Quadratrix.  The
vertical coordinate of this point is our y value.  Now compute y/3 (via a
compass and straightedge construction if desired).  Next draw a horizontal
line of height y/3 on our graph, which gives us the point C.  Drawing a line
from C to O gives us the angle COB, an angle one third the size of angle AOB.
</p><p>
<img src="angtri_files/fig6.gif">
</p><p>
As I mentioned before this curve can be computed and plotted via a computer.
The formula to find points on the curve is defined as x = y*cot(Pi*y/2).  Yes
here the vertical variable, y, is the independent variable, and the horizontal
variable, x, is the dependent variable.  So once the table of values is found,
the coordinates will need to be flipped to correctly plot the Quadratrix.
</p><p>

Now a justification for the formula.  In the following figure, B =(x,y) is
a point on the Quadratrix of Hippias.  Let BO be a line segment from the
origin to B and and BOC be our angle A.  If we draw in a unit circle, and
drop a
vertical line from the intersection of the angle we get similar triangles
and see that sin(A)/cos(A) = y/x, or tan(A) = y/x.  But earlier we defined
a point (x,y) on the Quadratrix to satisfy y=2*A/Pi.  So we get
tan(Pi*y/2)=y/x or equivalently x = y*cot(Pi*y/2).
</p><p>

</p><p>

So we now have two different ways of trisecting an angle.  I learned
about the construction of the second method in Underwood Dudley's book:
"A Budget of Trisections".  In the book Dudley describes several other
legitimate methods for trisecting an angle as well as compass and straightedge
constructions that people have claimed trisect an angle.  The book also
contains entertaining excerpts of letters from these "angle trisectors".
</p><p>

Besides stating it is impossible to trisect an angle, I think other
problems occur in discussing angle trisection.  One difficulty is in
explaining what it means for something to be impossible in a mathematical
sense.  I definitely remember in high school being told that it was
impossible to trisect an angle.  But I think at the time it meant the same
thing to me as that it was impossible for me to drive a car.  I was only
14 years old and I could not get a license to drive a car for another two
years so it was just not possible AT THAT TIME.  I do not remember being
told that when something is impossible in mathematics, it was not possible
five million years ago, it is not possible now, and it will never be possible
in the future.  Granted I may not have been ready for an explanation of
mathematical logic and proof, but a statement like, "It is impossible to
trisect an angle with a straightedge and a compass.  This means it is no
more possible to trisect an angle with those tools, then it is to add 1
and 2 and get 4" would have been much more powerful. (I am assuming here
that we all count the same way: 1, 2, 3, 4, ...)
</p><p>

I did not intend to attack my high school teacher; I learned an incredible
amount of mathematics from her as well as a deep love for the subject.
Maybe my teacher did explain what the words "mathematically impossible"
meant, and I just do not remember her comments.  Regardless, I think a
discussion of impossible in the mathematical sense would be an interesting
and valuable topic to discover in high school.  Are there any teachers out
there who have spent time talking about mathematical impossibilities?
