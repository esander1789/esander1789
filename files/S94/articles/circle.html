Can you find a way to cover all of R^3 with disjoint geometric
circles?  In other words, can you place disjoint geometric circles in
R^3 so that every point in R^3 is on one and only one of the geometric
circles?

</p><p>

A geometric circle is the set of points in a fixed plane that lie a
fixed positive distance from a center point that lies in the same
plane.  (Notice that circle refers to the curve, and not to the disk it
bounds.)

</p><p>

To give the idea, here is a way to fill all of R^3 except the vertical
axis: label the vertical axis the z-axis. At each fixed height (z =
constant), put a circle of every positive radius centered at the
z-axis. Since circles of radius of zero are not allowed, this
set of circles does not cover the z-axis.

</p><p>

In this example, nearby points in R^3 (off the z-axis) are contained
in circles with nearby centers and nearby radii -- in other words this
example shows a continuous method of filling R^3 minus the z-axis with
disjoint geometric circles.  However, for this puzzle, it is not
necessary to fill R^3 in a continuous manner. In fact, the solution
that I give will have some discontinuities.
