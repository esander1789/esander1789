As some people pointed out, the points which you can reach even after
an arbitrarily long time form something called a Sierpinski gasket.
This is the part of the equilateral triangle remaining after
repeatedly removing inverted equilateral triangles of half the height.
The following shows the removal of the first four sets of
triangles:

Here is an approximate picture made by having the
computer play the game above. This includes points that are not
contained in the gasket, but it looks approximately like the gasket:

There is an important distinction between looking almost the same and
really being the set.  Please see a comment on this by John Conway. If
I had chosen a starting point in the gasket, I would have the gasket,
rather than adding any points. I also have enclosed the program used
to generate this gasket so that if you are skeptical, you can fiddle
with the program and convince yourself.
</p><p>
One way to solve the problem is to consider what happens to the entire
triangle when it goes halfway to a vertex. The result will be a
triangle starting at that vertex, but with half the side length of the
original. Thus no matter which of the three vertices you pick, you
will miss the middle equilateral triangle. Therefore the set of points
points you can reach after going halfway to a vertex once is exactly
the same as the first step in constructing the Sierpinski gasket (see
the pictures). Likewise, looking at what happens when each of these
three triangles goes halfway to each vertex gives the second step in
constructing the Sierpinski gasket. In fact, at each step, the set of
all possible points after going halfway to the vertices is the same as
the set of points left at that step of computing the gasket.
</p><p>
I wanted to add a comment about what happens if instead of allowing
you to pick the vertex, I specify a particular sequence of vertices;
in particular, what if the vertices must be chosen in a cyclic
permutation? I tried this, and only saw three limit points on the
screen. At first I thought there was a mistake in the code, but then I
realized that this follows from the contraction mapping principle.
This suggests a more general principle at work regarding the limit
points of any specified sequence. I do not wish to elaborate in this
article. It is similar to the relationship between middle third Cantor
sets and infinite sequences of zeros and ones. For more information,
try Devaney's book Introduction to Chaotic Dynamical Systems.

The Sierpinski gasket is fairly trendy; in addition to being
aesthetically pleasing, it is a fractal. Although there are many
explanations of this idea, let me briefly explain. The Sierpinski
gasket has fractional Hausdorff dimension; here is an intuitive
definition of Hausdorff dimension. It is not meant to be at all
rigorous. I will give a reference for a more precise definition.
</p><p>
Given a straight line segment of length one in the plane, it fits
exactly inside an equilateral triangle of height one. How many
triangles of height 1/2 does it take to cover the line segment?
Exactly two. How many triangles of height 1/4 does it take? Exactly
four. Thus the height of the triangle is inversely proportional to the
number of triangles it takes to cover. We call a shape which
eventually has this property dimension one. Now consider an
equilateral triangle of height one in the plane. How many equilateral
triangles of height 1/2 does it take to cover the shape now? Exactly
four. How many triangle of height 1/4 does it take to cover? Sixteen.
Thus the square of the height of the triangle is inversely
proportional to the number of triangles needed to cover. We call a
shape which eventually has this property dimension two. Now consider
the Sierpinski gasket. It takes one triangle of height one to cover,
three triangles of height 1/2, nine triangles of height 1/4, and etc.
Thus the dimension of the gasket must be somewhere between one and
two. In fact, it must be dimension log(3)/log(2). Thus the gasket is a
fractal.

Thank you to everyone who asked questions and took such an interest in
this puzzle. I will have to post more in geometry.puzzles. Hope you
enjoyed it too.
