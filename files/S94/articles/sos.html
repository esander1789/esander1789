</p><h1>Shape of Space: Geometry Center's New Video</h1>

Evelyn Sander<br>
June 5, 1995


<p>

What is the shape of the universe? It is possible that it is Euclidean
three-space: infinite volume, with no straight path returning to meet
itself. However, the universe might also be finite in volume. You
might be able to travel on a straight path and return to your starting
point. How is this possible? This is the question addressed in the
Geometry Center's new movie The Shape of Space. This article describes
the movie, the making of the movie, and describes some future
materials development for it. Although the plans for distribution are
not yet decided, I wanted to write this article now to announce the
good news that the movie has just been accepted to the SIGGRAPH 95
Computer Animation Festival/ Electronic Theatre and also into this
year's SIGGRAPH Video Review.

</p><p>

The Shape of Space is an eleven minute introduction to two- and
three-manifolds intended for students grades 6-12. It describes the
sphere, torus, and Mobius strip, and related three-dimensional
objects. Although the ideas are quite sophisticated, the movie manages
to develop them clearly enough that a junior high and high school
audience can understand. It is designed to stand alone without any
need for preparatory lectures or exercises before the video.

</p><p>

Here is a brief illustrated description of the plot. On the three
figures below, click anywhere on the figure to get an mpeg of the
appropriate scene.

</p><p>
<a name="FIG1"></a>
How can a space ship go in a straight line and return
to where it started? The movie describes this possibility in
two-dimensional objects such as the sphere, the torus, and the Mobius
strip. Figure 1 shows a space ship returning to its starting point in
the two-dimensional torus. It shows both the standard torus and the
square with sides identified.

Moving on to three-dimensions, the movie describes a series of
three-manifolds created by identifying sides of a box. This is the
three-dimensional analogue of identifying sides of a square. For
example, Figure 2 shows a view from inside a three-torus.

Figure 3 shows the view from inside the three-dimensional analogue of
a Klein bottle.

</p><p>

In both figures 2 and 3, although there are only two stars and one
space ship, the identification of sides makes the space appear to go
on forever and be filled with stars and ships.

Jeff Weeks has been lecturing on the shape of space for the last ten
years and has written a book on the subject. The Geometry Center movie
is based on Weeks' book. In 1992, Celeste Fowler created a draft of
the video at the Center. However, it was not until December that a
proposal for a production quality video went through. Technical
production started in mid-January. Stuart Levy, Tamara Munzner, and
Lori Thomson worked on the video at the Center, with remote help from
Charlie Gunn, Delle Maxwell, and Jeff Weeks. On April 25th, 1995 with
rejoicing and popcorn, the movie had its debut at the Geometry Center.

</p><p>

An under four month production time makes this by far the shortest
production time video from the Center. This is especially remarkable,
since it also had the smallest production staff.  They were able to
speed production time so enormously by starting with a carefully
followed script. In addition, in March, a draft went to three test
sites of students and a test site of teachers. The feedback from these
groups was very important in knowing what the students did not
understand and how to fix it.

</p><p>

This summer, teachers and students in the Center summer programs will
work as a team to create class materials to use in conjunction with
The Shape of Space.  In addition to these related class materials,
Jeff Weeks intends to improve his related Macintosh geometry software
and make it into arcade style video games. (For more information about
the current versions of Weeks' software, see Evelyn Sander,
<a href="http://www.geom.uiuc.edu/docs/forum/weeks_software/">Geometry Games.</a>)

This article is based on an interview with Lori Thomson, a member of
the production staff of The Shape of Space. Figures are stills from
the movie. mpegs are also from the movie, adapted for the Web by
Lori Thomson. Jeff Weeks' book is Jeff Weeks, "The Shape of Space,"
Marcel Dekker, Inc, New York, 1985.

<h3><i>Errata</i></h3>

<p>

It has come to my attention that Celeste Fowler's 1992 draft of the
Shape of Space video was inspired by a previous draft by Carol Sohn,
Karen Olsson, and Prem Janardhan. The three were student interns in at
the Geometry Center 1992; they created some of the initial Shape of
Space scenes for their summer project.
