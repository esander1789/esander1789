</p><h1>Viewing Four-dimensional Objects In Three Dimensions</h1>

Given that humans only visualize three dimensions, how is it possible
to visualize four dimensional, or higher, objects?  This question is
the underlying idea of a short novel written over a hundred years ago
by Edwin A. Abbot called <i>Flatland</i>.  <i>Flatland</i> is a story
about two-dimensional creatures-- triangles, squares, circles and
other polygons--that live on a plane.  The story contains a section
where one of the squares is visited by a three-dimensional object, a
sphere.  The sphere explains to the square the existence of higher
dimensional objects like itself, and ways in which the square can
understand the form of such objects.  The method the sphere gives to
the square can be generalized so that the form of four-dimensional
objects can be seen in three dimensions.  This method of viewing
higher dimensional objects as well as others is one way people can
understand the shape of higher dimensional space.</p><p>

Before attempting to view four-dimensional objects in
three-dimensional space, let us consider viewing a three dimensional
object in two-dimensional space.  In <i>Flatland</i>, the method in
which the sphere showed its form to square was by raising its body
through the Flatland surface.  The square saw at first a point that
quickly grew to a circle, which continued increasing in size, and then
started decreasing in size until it became a point, and then it
disappeared.  So the square perceived the sphere to be an infinite
collection of circles pieced together.  The following is a series of
pictures that show the sphere as it rises through the plane as the
square saw it:</p><p>

The flatlander square just as easily could have seen what a cube
looked like by the following rising of the cube through space:</p><p>

Before continuing further, it should be mentioned that for
simplicity's sake and for aesthetic purposes, the forms which we will
consider viewing are polytopes, the generalized term for polyhedra and
polygons.</p><p>

A second way to view three dimensional polytopes in two dimensions is
by means of a projection.  Projection is a popular method for
Cartographers to create maps of the world from a globe.  For instance
the United Nations flag is created by a projection of the globe about
the south pole.  One especially useful type of projection in
mathematics is called stereographic projection.  Stereographic
projection takes a sphere and maps it over the entire plane in the
following manner.  If one lays a sphere on a plane, the point of the
sphere touching the plane stays fixed while the point directly
opposite it, i.e. "the North Pole" gets sent to infinity.  Any other
point on the sphere is sent to the unique point on the plane found by
intersecting the plane with a line made from the point at the north
pole and the point on the sphere.  The following picture is an example
of a cube which is contained in the sphere, stereographically
projected onto the plane.  Such a picture is also called a Schlegel
diagram:</p><p>

Note that instead of projecting the Cube in the manor shown above, the
cube could have been rotated so that its faces were not parallel and
perpendicular to the plane, but rather at different angles which would
result in a different projection.</p><p>


A third way to view polyhedra in two-dimensions is through a method
defined by Barbara Hausmann and Hans-Peter Seidel as "Cut-Throughs"
and "Fold-Downs".  Since polyhedra have as faces regular polygons, one
could cut a polyhedra on the edges and fold it in a way so that all
the faces are lying on the plane.  Here is an example of the cube
after it has been cut-through and folded-down:</p><p>

As you may have already surmised, all of the above methods can be used
to visualize four dimensional polytope in three dimensions.  But
before showing these different ways of viewing polytopes, an
explanation of how these polytopes are constructed is in order.  As
regular polyhedra are constructed from regular polygons, so are
regular 4-dimensional polytopes constructed from regular polyhedra.
Recall that there are only five regular polyhedra:</p><p>

</p><ol>
<li>The tetrahedron, constructed from four equilateral triangles.
</li><li>The cube, constructed from six squares.
</li><li>The octahedron, constructed from eight equilateral triangles.
</li><li>The dodecahedron, constructed from 12 regular pentagons.
</li><li>The icosahedron, constructed from twenty equilateral triangles.
</li></ol>

There are only six four-dimensional regular polytopes.  They are the
following:<p>

</p><ol>
<li>The 4-simplex, constructed from five tetrahedra, three tetrahedra
meeting at an edge.
</li><li>The hypercube, constructed from eight cubes meeting three per
edge.
</li><li>The 16-cell, constructed from sixteen tetrahedra, with four
tetrahedra meeting at an edge.
</li><li>The 24-cell, constructed from 24 octahedra, with three octahedra
meeting per edge.
</li><li>The 120-cell, constructed from 120 dodecahedra, with three
dodecahedra meeting per edge.
</li><li>The monstrous 600-cell, constructed from 600 tetrahedra, with five
tetrahedra meeting at an edge.
</li></ol>


Since the above examples of viewing three-dimensional polytopes in two
dimensions all contain the cube, let us continue viewing in the fourth
dimension by looking at the hypercube.  First, let us look at some
projections of the hypercube.  Each of the following diagrams were
created by rotating the hypercube about a plane in four dimensions, or
a combination of plane rotations.<p>

The following sequence of pictures is of a slicing of the hypercube
into three dimensions.  Note that as the hypercube passes through our
three-dimensional space, it is growing and then shrinking from various
polyhedra shapes.  This is analogous to the slicing of the cube in the
plane shown earlier.</p><p>

The last set of pictures shows the step-by-step approach of the
hypercube being cut-through and folded-down.  Note that in each stage
of the process a cube pops out of the hypercube, which is analogous to
a square coming out of a cube as one dissects a cube.

In <i>Flatland</i>, the square discovered that the sphere was an
infinite collection of circles.  However the square was unable ever to
actually view the sphere in the same way we three-dimensional beings
are able.  Similarly, we can discover what some four-dimensional
objects look like by viewing aspects of them in three dimensions.  But
like the square, we are limited in understanding the whole nature of
these objects.</p><p>
