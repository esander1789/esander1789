</p><h1>Jig Saw Puzzle</h1>

<p>

Bolt a metal rod to the end of the blade of a jig saw so that the rod
can pivot in one plane. Here is a sketch of the object:

</p><p>

<img src="jigsaw_files/jigsaw.gif">

</p><p>

In the first picture the rod and blade are facing to the
right. However, the rod can pivot. Therefore with the motor off, if
the rod is not held facing right, it will fall (second picture) and
point downward (third picture). When the motor is on, the blade moves
left to right. The puzzle is about how turning the motor on effects
the natural position of the rod.

</p><p>

What would you expect to happen if with the motor running you point
the object so that the rod and the blade face directly upward?  Will
the rod fall to point downward? Will it continue to point upward
direction?  Or will it instead point at some angle from the vertical?
Consider the case in which the length of the rod is much larger than
the gravitational acceleration over the square of the frequency of the
jigsaw blade.

</p><p>

This puzzle is by no means easy. However, since it is not too hard to
visualize what is happening physically, I wanted to give let you think
about the situation before I say what happens and why.

</p><p>

</p><h1>Solution to the Jig Saw Puzzle</h1>

<p>

geometry.puzzles,geometry.research, 9 Jan 1995.

</p><p>

Answer: For a sufficiently long rod, the rod will continue to point
upward.

</p><p>

Why: This is a famous physics problem, but the explanation I give here
is mathematical.

</p><p>

The equation for the angle x of the rod is:

</p><p>

L x'' + (-g + a(t)) x = 0

</p><p>

where L is the length of the rod (if we assume that the mass of the
rod is concentrated at the end), g is the gravitational acceleration,
and a(t) is the acceleration of the jigsaw blade.

We want to show the stability of the equilibrium point where the rod
points upward with no angular velocity. Call this equilibrium point
E. Note that this corresponds to a point in phase space, the space
angular velocity vectors of the form (x,x')=(angle, angular velocity).

</p><p>

Since the saw blade moves very quickly up and down, the acceleration
of the blade is much larger than g. Therefore we can treat g as a
small perturbation. In fact, we show stability in the case of g=0 and
moreover, that stability cannot be destroyed by small perturbations,
which means stability persists when g is present.

</p><p>

Assume that a(t) is constant through each half-period. The
gravity-free equation is

</p><p>

x" + w^2 x = 0 when accelerated downward, and
<br>
x" - w^2 x = 0 when accelerated upward.

</p><p>

In the second case, this rod behaves like the standard swinging
pendulum, in which the equilibrium point at the top of the swing is
unstable. Thus the rod accelerates away from the vertical.  Since the
length of the rod is assumed large compared to the time that the saw
blade is accelerated downward, the rod does not move very far during a
single half-period of the saw blade.  For the first equation, the
rod's acceleration is restoring, i.e. it points toward the vertical.
Thus the restoring accleration during the down phase competes with the
destabilizing acceleration during the up phase. Interestingly, the
stabilization wins over destabilization. Here is a geometrical reason
behind this phenomenon.

</p><p>

The points (x, x') move in ellipses for one half period; we stretch
these ellipses into circles by setting Y=x'/w (and keeping X=x). The
equations become:

</p><p>

X'=     w Y	***
<br>
Y'= -/+ w X.

</p><p>

So for half the period now we have the usual rotation with angular
velocity w. For the other half period a hyperbolic rotation with the
same rate w. That is, the flow moves towards the origin along the line
x=y, moves away from the origin along the line x=-y, and all other
points move on hyperbolas.

</p><p>

How do we combine the information about the two half-periods to get
information about the total system? Rather than looking at the entire
flow for stability, we can look at only the angular velocity vector of
the rod when the saw blade is at its highest point. This turns out to
give us enough information to determine stability; let P be the two by
two matrix corresponding to the linearized system at the equilibrium
point. It gives the angular velocity vector of the rod after the blade
goes one period based on the rod's current position. In other words,
if T is the period of the blade, P is the matrix such that for the
linearized system:

</p><p>

(x(T),x'(T))= P (x(0), x'(0)).

</p><p>

It turns out that the equilibrium point is stable exactly when all
iterates of the matrix P are bounded. P has determinant one, since it
must be area preserving since the system is conservative.

</p><p>

The key observation is that the composition of the rotation in
equation *** and the "equal strength" hyperbolic rotation in equation
*** turns every point by a nonzero angle. This is because the angular
velocity of the vectors under the rotational flow is w, while the
angular velocity of the vectors under the hyperbolic flow is strictly
less (except on the x- and y- axes, which are passed intantaneously).
This is clear geometrically since the speed of both vector fields is
the same, while one is perpenducular to radius vector and the other is
not, and thus "wastes" itself on lengthening or shortening rather than
just rotating. Thus the composition of the two turns every initial
condition by a nonzero amount (less than pi, if the frequency of the
jigsaw is high enough).

</p><p>

In other words, matrix P for angular velocity of the system after time
T has no real eigenvectors and thus must diagonalize to
diag(lambda_1,lambda_2) with lambdas on the unit circle. Thus P has
all its iterates bounded.

</p><p>

Finally, the above property of P is not destroyed by a small
perturbation, and thus adding g does not affect stability.

</p><p>

Thus E is a stable equilibrium.

</p><p>

This article is based on a seminar and interview with RPI professor
Mark Levi during his recent visit to the Geometry Center.

</p><h1>Jigsaw Puzzle 2</h1>

Here is another "puzzle" which appears
similar but is actually much more difficult. If you are not an expert
in this kind of thing, you may want to just look at the answer. The
answer will in fact only give a general explanation rather than all
the specific details.

<p>


What happens as the length of the rod becomes arbitrarily small?


</p><p>

</p><h1>Solution to Jig Saw Puzzle 2</h1>

geometry.puzzles, geometry.research, 13 Jan 1995.

<p>

What happens as the length of the rod becomes arbitrarily small? As
the rod's length vanishes, there are infinitely many regions in which the
equilibrium point is stable.

</p><p>

Because of this relationship between the differential equation and the
the space of two by two matrices with determinant one, the proof of
stability relies on the geometry of this space of two by two matrices
with determinant one. Every two by two matrix with determinant one can
be written as the product of a symmetric matrix and a rotation.

</p><p>

Each symmetric matrix is uniquely determined by the expansion
direction and the amount of expansion, where the expansion direction is
irrelevant if the amount of expansion is one. Thus the set of symmetric
matrices is homeomorphic to the open disk.

</p><p>

Each rotation matrix is uniquely determined by an angle of
rotation. The set of rotation matrices is homeomorphic to the
circle.

</p><p>

Combining the last two paragraphs, the set of two by two matrices with
determinant one is a solid torus. Also notice that if M is any
symmetric matrix times a rotation of pi/2, then M to the fourth power
is equal to M. Thus at the angle pi/2, every matrix is stable. In fact
an open neighborhood of the set of these matrices consists of stable
matrices. This means that every time you go around the solid torus,
you hit a region of stability.

</p><p>

It turns out that if the length goes to zero, the matrix goes around
the torus infinitely many times.  More precisely, as the length
shortens so that the number of vertical moments (i.e. moments during
the jigsaw's period when the pendulum becomes vertical) changes by 5
or more, the matrix goes at least once around the torus.

</p><p>

Thus as the length of the rod decreases to zero, there are infinitely
many regions of stability.

</p><p>

As with the previous part, this was based on a seminar, interview, and
subsequent correspondence with Mark Levi.
