Address
======

Department of Mathematical Sciences  
George Mason University, MS 3F2   
4400 University Drive  
Fairfax, VA 22030   

Research Interests
======

My research is on primarily in the fields of dynamical systems and mathematical visualization and design.  Current dynamical work focuses on studying systems with chaos and quasiperiodicity, and on developing rigorous computational methods for bifurcation theory. Visualization work concentrates on using 3D printing to create tangible objects from abstract mathematical concepts, and to design experimental objects to test mathematical models.
