1. [Pendulum Gyrations](https://math.gmu.edu/~sander/EvelynSite/pendulum-gyrations.html), Meanderings of attractor basins for the forced damped pendulum, 2014, by Evelyn Sander and Jim Yorke.
1. [Homoclinic Bifurcation in the Henon Map](http://math.gmu.edu/~sander/movies/henon.mov), 2015, by Evelyn Sander.
1. [Nucleation](http://math.gmu.edu/~wanner/nucsim/index.html), 2010, by Thomas Wanner. Views from our paper on the nature of phase separation in ternary alloys.
1. [Spinodal Decomposition](http://math.gmu.edu/~wanner/spidec/index.html), 2008, by Thomas Wanner. An mesoscopic view of a metal alloy as it undergoes phase separation. In a series of papers, we have been able to give an explanation for the nature of the early pattern formation.
1. [A Three-Dimensional Explosion](http://math.gmu.edu/~sander/movies/prlatt/prlattractor.html), 2007. Watch as the movie's attractive star undergoes an drastic unstable event leading to new depth of character.
1. [Synchronization Sets in Drive-Response Systems](http://www.dynamicalsystems.org/pi/sm/detail?item=35), 2003. In which a loop of synchrony turns into a zigzag, available from the SIAM DSWeb Picture Gallery.
1. [Spinodal Decomposition](http://math.gmu.edu/~sander/movies/spinum.html), 1999. Binary alloys forming in glorious color.
1. [The Arnold Cat Map Movie](http://math.gmu.edu/~sander/movies/arnold.html), 1998. Starring Marlowe the Cat (see glamour shot below). Watch the star become very mixed up.
1. [The Arnold Clown Map Movie](http://math.gmu.edu/~sander/movies/arnoldclown.html), 1998. Sequel to the Arnold Cat Map Movie. It is the same map, different main actor, different embedding.
1. [New Tangencies Form From Old Intersections](http://math.gmu.edu/~sander/movies/tangle.html), 1998. A sequel to Creation of a Homoclinic Tangle. This is a quick dynamical flick also known as The Lambda Lemma in Action. A narcissistic tale of a manifold becoming attracted to itself as a result of crossing the path of another manifold. (PG-13)
1. [Creation of the Homoclinic Tangle](http://math.gmu.edu/~sander/movies/bifl.mpeg), 1998. This movie is quite chaotic in parts, but there is some subtle character development.
