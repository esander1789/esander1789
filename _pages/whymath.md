A math major prepares you for many interesting, important, satisfying, well-paid jobs. Here is some evidence:

- [Why Do Math](http://www.whydomath.org/) has a number of high level specific examples showing that math solves important and interesting problems. Dr. Math’s [Why Study Math](http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.why.math.html) gives a lower level answer to this question.
- [When Will I Use Math](http://weusemath.org/) shows how important math is in every type of training.
- [Exploring a Career With Numbers](https://www.discoverdatascience.org/resources/exploring-a-career-with-numbers/) describes some careers available to math and related majors.
- Forbes Magazine rated mathematician as the [Best Job of 2014](http://www.forbes.com/pictures/mkl45efdek/1-mathematician/), with tenured university professor, statistician, and actuary as the next three best.
- The Wall Street Journal’s 2009 [Career Journal](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123119236117055127.html) rated mathematician, actuary, and statistician as the three best jobs.
- [Why Major in Math](http://www.math.duke.edu/major/whyMajor.html) gives detailed statistics to show that math majors do well on entrance exams, have high salaries, and have high job satisfaction.
- The Mathematical Association of America’s [](http://www.maa.org/careersl)[Mathematics Careers](http://www.maa.org/careers) gives further information about careers, as well as a link to books on math careers. [Career Profiles](http://www.maa.org/careers/career-profiles) gives specific examples.
- The [SIAM Careers in Math](http://www.siam.org/careers/thinking.php) gives an overview of different careers available with a math major.

Math majors are successful in many career paths in addition to teacher, professor, or actuary. Here are a few examples:

- Christine Fox has a BS in math and MS applied math from George Mason University. She is a presidentially-appointed assistant to the Sec. of Defense. See articles about her in the [Washington Post](http://www.washingtonpost.com/gIQAVm3yDP_topic.html) and [Mason Gazette](http://gazette.gmu.edu/articles/7415). She was the inspiration for a character in Top Gun.
- Carson Chow is a PhD mathematician working at NIH to solve the obesity epidemic, as described in [A Mathematical Challenge to Obesity](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/15/science/a-mathematical-challenge-to-obesity.html?_r=0), New York Times, May 14, 2012.
- [Jill Mesirov](http://www.broadinstitute.org/history-leadership/leadership/jill-p-mesirov) is a PhD mathematician who is associate director at the MIT/Harvard Broad Institute. She uses mathematics to study biology, including work on cures for cancer.
- DJ Patil is a PhD mathematician who is currently the Data Scientist in Residence at Greylock Partners. Here is a video of him telling the business community about mathematical chaos in the video [Living in a Chaotic World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5aWYA8coSrc).
